# Realtime Payment Platform

A Java 25 / Spring Boot 4.0.1 payment-processing demonstrator with the intended flow:

`Transaction API -> Kafka -> Transaction Processor -> PostgreSQL`

The API intake slice is implemented. The processor is still a bootstrap application;
ledger persistence and end-to-end idempotency are not implemented yet.

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `shared-contracts` | Framework-free versioned events and shared value types |
| `transaction-api` | HTTP structural validation and confirmed Kafka publication |
| `transaction-processor` | Future deterministic validation and idempotent ledger persistence |

See [project state](docs/PROJECT_STATE.md), the
[architecture](docs/architecture/real-time-payment-processing-platform.md), and
[intake ADR](docs/adr/0001-transaction-intake-contract.md).

## Run the intake demo

Prerequisites: JDK 25 (`JAVA_HOME` configured), Docker with Linux containers, and
Maven/image registry access for dependencies not already cached.

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd -pl shared-contracts -am install
.\mvnw.cmd -pl transaction-api spring-boot:test-run
```

The test launcher starts `apache/kafka-native:4.1.1`, provisions
`transactions.received` with three partitions and one replica, and starts the API
on port 8080. These disposable containers are for local development only.

To use an existing broker instead, provision `transactions.received`, set
`KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS`, and run `spring-boot:run` instead of `spring-boot:test-run`.
The default bootstrap address is `localhost:9092`. The topic name can be overridden
with the `payments.kafka.received-topic` Spring property.

```powershell
$transactionBody = @{
    transactionId = 'TX-2026-0001'
    correlationId = 'CORR-2026-0001'
    accountId = 'ACC-100'
    amount = 250.00
    currency = 'EUR'
    type = 'TRANSFER'
} | ConvertTo-Json

Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/transactions' `
    -Headers @{ 'Idempotency-Key' = 'TX-2026-0001' } `
    -ContentType 'application/json' -Body $transactionBody
```

Successful publication returns HTTP 202 and
`{"transactionId":"TX-2026-0001","correlationId":"CORR-2026-0001"}`.
This confirms intake into Kafka, not ledger completion. There is no status-query
endpoint yet.

## Request and error contract

- All six request fields are required. IDs accept 1–64 ASCII letters, digits,
  underscores, or hyphens. `Idempotency-Key` must equal `transactionId`.
- Supply `correlationId` in the JSON body to identify the originating workflow.
  The API preserves it in `TransactionReceived` and the acceptance response. Reuse
  it on retries and propagate it unchanged through downstream services and events.
  It is separate from the idempotency key and may be shared by related transactions.
  Missing, blank, or malformed correlation IDs return 400 without publication.
- `amount` is decimal with at most 15 integer and 2 fractional digits. Currency is
  three uppercase letters; `TRANSFER` is the only current transaction type.
- Sign checks and supported-currency business rules belong to the future processor.
  A structurally valid negative amount can therefore receive 202 at intake.
- Retry with the same ID, key, and payload. Retries may publish multiple events.
  Reusing an ID with a changed payload is not detected across requests yet.

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 202 | Kafka confirmed publication; response contains `transactionId` and `correlationId` |
| 400 | Missing/malformed header, malformed JSON, or invalid request fields |
| 409 | Well-formed `Idempotency-Key` differs from the body `transactionId` |
| 415 | Unsupported request content type |
| 503 | Publication could not be confirmed; outcome may be uncertain |

Error bodies use `application/problem+json` without including rejected field values
or internal failure details. This local demo does not yet implement authentication.

## Tests

Run focused unit and MVC tests without Docker:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd '-pl=transaction-api,transaction-processor' -am '-Dtest=ReceiveTransactionTests,TransactionControllerTests,KafkaTransactionPublisherTests,TransactionReceivedContractTests' '-Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false' test
```

Run the Kafka publication integration test with Docker:

```powershell
.\mvnw.cmd -pl transaction-api -am '-Dtest=TransactionPublicationTests' '-Dsurefire.failIfNoSpecifiedTests=false' test
```

The repository's complete validation command remains `.\mvnw.cmd clean verify`.
Container-backed tests currently run through Surefire as `*Tests`; they are not
separated into a Failsafe phase. Kafka is pinned to `4.1.1` and PostgreSQL to `17.6`.
Spring Boot manages JUnit Jupiter 6.0.1, as required by Spring Framework 7, despite
the older JUnit 5 wording in the project instructions.

Compose, CI, ledger migrations, consumer recovery tests, and operational dashboards
remain future work.
